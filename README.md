Module 3 Challenge - March 11
For this assignment I used the following process:
- Reviewed past Solved in-classroom activities and copied/pasted the code
- Updated variables to the CD, Savings & Interest names
-Used my Python proramming Quick Study Guide (bought form office depot) to find the calculations for interest. it was listed under the "Coding Structures" List Operations section.
- Added the prompt language for calculations
- I compared my work to what was shown during office hours and realized that I had added values/information/spaces that was causing me syntax errors. Some of the issues I had were:
    - extra parenthesis infront of FLOAT function
    - extra commas in interest calculations
    - interest rate when it should've been set to "0"
    - capitalized some variables first letters but not others
    - removed "-" form file names and changed to "_"

- I took adavantage of an additional office hour on 3/12 where instructor reviewed the variables I had misnamed between files. One was called "CD_Interest" and in another file "CD_Earned_Interest."
- I went through it again to remove final spaces that were causing issues and uneccesary "print" functions I had added.
- Prepared file to submit
